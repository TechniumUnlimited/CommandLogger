CommandLogger
Command Logger is a mod that will assist server admins in auditing and tracking use of commands. It will by default log all commands to the server's logs/commandsauditlog.log file, but can be configured to only log commands by ops, users, both, or neither (if neither, the mod has no functionality though).

Each command executed will be logged with a timestamp, username, command used, and player who issued the command.

This mod is only required serverside.
